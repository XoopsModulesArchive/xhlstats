*) Fix: gluongun.gif / tau_cannon.gif were mixed up. (S. Garner)
*) Fix: "gluongun" should be "gluon gun". (S. Garner)
*) Fix: month value for timelocal() should be 0..11 not 1..12, this prevented
   hlstats.pl from working correctly in December! (S. Garner)
*) Fix: suicide and teamkill skill penalties were being erroneously changed into
   +1 skill bonuses. (S. Garner, with thanks to Surtr <surtr@waygate.net>)
*) Fix: playerinfo reported Aliases as expiring after DELETE_DAYS. (S. Garner)
*) Fix: duplicate '357' weapon in gamesupport_valve. (S. Garner)
*) New: RconRecord configuration option, set to 0 to disable recording logged
   rcon commands to the Events_Admin table (useful for PB servers). (S. Garner)

   (only team rewards). (S. Garner)
*) Fix: escape HTML in player names when displaying awards. (S. Garner)
*) Fix: NameTrack mode should work better. (S. Garner)

   configuration setting should work now! (S. Garner)

   problem. (S. Garner, with thanks to buddha <buddha@buddhapest.com>)

*) Changed hlstats-awards.pl to only generate awards for games where hidden='0',
   and to generate awards in game, type order. (S. Garner)
*) Added --nodebug (-n) option to hlstats.pl and hlstats-resolve.pl. For each
   occurence, the debug level is reduced by 1. This is useful if hlstats.conf
   specifies e.g DebugLevel 1 and you want to run hlstats-resolve.pl with a
   DebugLevel of 0 -- just add -n to the command line. (S. Garner)
*) Split game-specific data out of hlstats.sql into separate gamesupport_*.sql
   files. (S. Garner)
*) Added UPGRADE.html. (S. Garner)
*) When editing or creating a server, the IP Address will be checked to make
   sure it is a correctly formatted dotted-decimal IP address (i.e. not a
   hostname). (S. Garner)
*) Rearrange admin settings into Game-specific groups for easier management of
   data. (S. Garner)
*) Add unique key (game, awardType, code) to Awards table. (S. Garner)
*) Added new define("PLATFORM"), allowing for a MySQL Windows bug workaround in
   tools_reset. (S. Garner)
*) Fixed bug in uniqueid tracking when gameserver is restarted. May help both
   Normal and NameTrack modes. (S. Garner)

   To achieve this, EditList class now supports setting a maxlength for text
   fields; fields throughout the admin now have maxlengths to match their
   column sizes in the database. (S. Garner)
*) Added Public Address and Rcon Password options to Servers, and put Public
   Address and Status URL into "Advanced View". Fixed game.inc to show the
   Public Address if specified. Public Address can be used when any kind of
   log relaying program is being used and the IP and Port are not the real
   address of the game server. (S. Garner)
*) Added upgrade sql file. (S. Garner)
*) Increased size of tag column in hlstats_Clans to varchar(32). (S. Garner)
*) quoteSQL() now escapes \ as \\, too. (S. Garner)
*) Integrated player profile management stuff from HLstats-HLLOG into hllog.pl.
   HLstats-HLLOG will no longer be distributed. (S. Garner)
*) Die if no Events tables found with SHOW TABLES in tools_reset. (S. Garner)
*) Fall back to DELETE FROM if TRUNCATE TABLE fails in tools_reset. (S. Garner)
*) Explicitly set error_reporting level in hlstats.php. (S. Garner)

*) Fix incorrect valve weapon image file names, and changed to always look for
   all-lowercase weapon image files. (S. Garner)

*) New header design and slightly lighter default colour scheme. (S. Garner)
*) Fixed hlstats-awards.pl not awarding any action awards. (Vitriol, S. Garner)
*) Added weapon images for elite, ump45, fiveseven and sg550 for Counter-Strike.
   Added weapon images for Half-Life Deathmatch. Added these weapons to the
   default Weapons table. (S. Garner)
*) Added viewer option to players.inc to limit rankings to only players with
   greater than or equal to an arbitrary number of kills. (S. Garner)
*) Added utility to tools_optimize to upgrade all tables to MyISAM. (S. Garner)
*) Added support for tracking players by name (in addition to by WON ID or by IP
   Address). Enabled with Mode=NameTrack. (S. Garner)
*) Fixed connections not being logged. (S. Garner)
*) Fixed player-aliases incrementing Numuses and Lastuse for every event. Now
   correctly only increments when name changes. (S. Garner)



1.00-beta (released 2001-03-18)
*) Updated to use new HL Standard Log Format (http://www.hlstats.org/logs/).
   Rewrote much of hlstats.pl to take advantage of features of the new log
   format. (S. Garner)
*) New directive: MinPlayers. Player events will not be recorded if the number
   of players on the server is less than MinPlayers (default 2). (S. Garner)
*) Increased maxlength of weapon code in Weapons table to 32 chars. (S. Garner)
*) Added images for TFC weapons. (Neo, S. Garner)
*) New admin tool: Edit Player Or Clan Details. Allows for editing of a player
   or clan's profile information. (S. Garner)
*) Can now jump to a player's details page by passing a uniqueid (which can be a
   WON ID or an IP Address, depending on MODE) and game code in the URL instead
   of playerid, e.g.: hlstats.php?mode=playerinfo&uniqueid=123456&game=tfc
   Useful for server status utilities wanting to link directly to a player's
   details page. (S. Garner)
*) Clan tag patterns can now be customised; new admin section and new ClanTags
   database table. (S. Garner)
*) Multipage navigation in Table class (hlstats.php) now only shows maximum of
   20 pages, plus "First page" and "Last page" links. (S. Garner)
*) New script: hlstats-resolve.pl. Goes through Events_Connects resolving any
   unresolved IP addresses, and re-grouping hostnames.
*) Moved some common functions to HLstats.plib.
*) New admin tool: Host Statistics. Shows the most popular ISPs (hostnames) for
   players on your servers. (S. Garner)
*) Hostnames are grouped by the first 2 or 3 parts of the address (i.e.
   'max1.xyz.someisp.net' becomes 'someisp.net', and 'max1.xyz.someisp.net.nz'
   becomes 'someisp.net.nz'), but can also be grouped into user-defined group
   names defined with Admin: Host Groups (hlstats_HostGroups). (S. Garner)
*) Hostnames can now be optionally logged when players connect. A DNS reverse-
   lookup is performed on the player's IP. This can be enabled or disabled with
   the DNSResolveIP configuration directive or --dns-resolveip. The DNS timeout
   delay can also be set with DNSTimeout or --dns-timeout. (S. Garner)
*) New admin tool: Reset Statistics. Deletes all players, clans and events from
   relevant tables using TRUNCATE TABLE. (S. Garner)
*) New admin tool: Optimize Database. Runs OPTIMIZE TABLE and ANALYZE TABLE
   MySQL queries for all tables. Can increase database performance with large
   tables, if run regularly. (S. Garner)
*) New admin tool: Admin-Event History (interface for new Events_Admin and
   Events_Rcon tables). (S. Garner)
*) New "Tools" section in Admin interface. (S. Garner)
*) Log speed cheats and Admin Mod messages to hlstats_Events_Admin. (S. Garner)
*) Log Rcon commands to hlstats_Events_Rcon. (S. Garner)
*) Default behaviour is now to use MySQL server time (NOW()), instead of
   hlstats.pl time (time()) and game server time (timestamp on the log data).
   Only the MySQL server needs an accurate clock now. Added a UseTimestamp
   directive to alternatively still use the timestamp from log data. (S. Garner)
*) hlstats.pl can now accept log data on standard input. (S. Garner)
*) hlstats.pl and hlstats-awards.pl now use a common configuration file and
   accept various arguments on the command line. (S. Garner)
*) Add map image to map detail stats. New Option: map_dlurl. (S. Garner)
*) Add map detail stats (mapinfo.inc). (R. Yacketta, S. Garner)
*) Add weapon detail stats (weaponinfo.inc). (R. Yacketta, S. Garner)
*) Fix incorrect urlencode()ing of homepage URLs in playerinfo.inc and in
   claninfo.inc. (S. Garner)
*) Fix table->draw() incorrectly assuming imgdir is in DOCUMENT_ROOT. Now
   determines absolute path to imgdir from SCRIPT_NAME. (S. Garner)
*) Add DB_PCONNECT configuration define to hlstats.php, for optional persistent
   database connections. (S. Garner)
*) Add EXPERIMENTAL $g_mode = "LAN" for tracking players by IP address. The
   structure of some database tables had to be changed to accommodate this; an
   SQL file is provided for upgrading existing databases. (S. Garner)
*) Add $g_deletedays and DELETEDAYS configuration settings. (S. Garner)
*) Reorder regular expression matches in main loop in hlstats.pl; possible
   performance improvement. (S. Garner)
*) Fix some output bugs in hlstats.pl, and tidy up some messages. (S. Garner)



0.99-beta (released 2001-01-02)
*) First public release. (S. Garner)
